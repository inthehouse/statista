/* 
TODO: Pagination

NOTE: How I would approach Pagination component
Create relevant buttons and UI

Slice the data and use the state to manage the current page number and items per page.
When rendering, slice the array based on the current page and items per page to display only the relevant data.

Display only the sliced data

Since the data is not much, I wouldn't need to store data in an state management library.
